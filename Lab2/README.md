Effect of increasing frequency of the message

* When the message frequency is lower, the waveform is symmetrical around the x-axis.
* At 5k, the waveform becomes malformed because there is an operlap between -fc+fm and fc-fm.
* "Nyquist Rate" - message bandwidth must be at most half the carrier bandwidth.


## Exercise 2a) - Coherent Demodulation
* Scaled the output by a factor of 2
**MATTTTHS**
m(t)cos(2pifct)^2= m(t)(1/2(1+cos(4pifct)))

Explain briefly the mathematical theory behind this demodulation technique. Moreover, why
are we using a low pass filter and why do we have to get rid of the DC component? Why do you
need to scale the message amplitude?

## Exercise 3
* Envelope detection is better at very high frequencies.
